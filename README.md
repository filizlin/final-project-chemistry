### Assignment Instructions

> Write up a complete SEO plan for the site in the project's README.md. You don't have to implement it, but if you had infinite time, what would you do to make your site maximally search engine friendly? This should include at least one strategy we didn't discuss in class. In the writeup, mention which strategy/strategies you've already implemented.

- Complete SEO plan - SEO would be taken into account when designing the html code at the first place. The html tages are to be semantic and the different kinds of semantic tags would be used appropriatedly. The content of the website would need to include quality content and stands out from the other sources that is readily available, and having links other other related sites can also provide users a better experience. The meta-data (content type, title, description, viewport, etc) can help increase the searchability of the website, this part can be added at the beginning or later as the content is being developed. When working on the css designs, it is important to make sure that the layout is user friendly and the website can be easily navigated around. It can be a good idea to come up with some user stories and test of the ease of navigation for a diverse population. Accessiblity is another important part to take into account as this stage, having alt texts to the images and make usre the the site is responsive (for mobile and tablet) would aid in user experience. One other thing that can be key is the compatibility across the different systems and browsers. When writing the javascript, it is important to keep the site speed in mind and make sure that the different functions in the site doesn't take a long time to load, and also that the content can be load without need a high-end device or high-speed internet. Having a well-deisgned tagged images and related phrases for social media can also attract more users to visit the site (the presence on social media can definetely help increase the number of clicks!)

- Implemented SEO strategies - In the website that is created for this class, all the html codes include sufficient semantic tags and the meta-data were used. The color schemes for the site is checked for appropriate color contrast for accessiblity. The content uniqueness is described in the home page for the users to better know how to use the site. As this is a relatively simple site it doesn't take much time the load the javascript or design layout. To better respect the copyright, the use of images that was not authentic is purposly avoided. And related links to the other site is provided for the users to use this site as a starting point for researching. The website is deisnged to be responsive for tablets and mobiles.
